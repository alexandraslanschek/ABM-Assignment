    - Estimate for Switzerland (Grebner et al., 2010, p. 81)
    - What about estimates from Alexandra?
  - severity = 0.30
    - Middle between 0.20 and 0.40, which are minimum and maximum estimates for Germany (Kramer et al., 2013, p. 6)
    - Can we find data which is (1) more scientific and/or (2) related to colds more specifically?
  - recovery-days = 5
    - Lower bound of average duration of colds for adults (Pappas, 2017, p. 200)
    - Remember that 1 week = 5 days in our model
  - slower-recovery = 0.63
    - Results in 8 recovery days, which is upper bound of average duration of colds for adults
    - NHS (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/) recommends seeing general practitioner after 10 days
